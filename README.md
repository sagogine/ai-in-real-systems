# AI in Real Systems

This repository is about what it actually takes to use AI in **business, data, and analytics systems** once you move past demos.

Not model benchmarks.  
Not tool comparisons for their own sake.  
And definitely not “just add an LLM.”

The work here focuses on **systems**, the tradeoffs they force, and the ways AI breaks when it meets real data, real organizations, and real constraints.

## What this repository contains

You’ll find two kinds of things here:

- **Essays**  
  Long-form writing on applying AI in production data and analytics environments — where cost, reliability, ownership, and trust matter more than novelty.

- **Small prototypes**  
  Narrow, opinionated experiments built to test specific assumptions (often to show where those assumptions fail).

Along the way, this repo captures lessons learned — including ideas that didn’t work, or worked only under very specific conditions.

## The questions this work keeps coming back to

1. **Business reality**  
   Why many AI initiatives fail not because the models are bad, but because expectations are misaligned with operational reality.

2. **Data truth**  
   The difference between data being available and data being trustworthy — and why LLMs tend to amplify existing data problems rather than fix them.

3. **System constraints**  
   Latency, cost, security, blast radius, and scale — the constraints that quietly shape whether an AI system survives in production.

4. **Organizational maturity**  
   Why ownership, process, and incentives often matter more than architecture or model choice.

## How this repository evolves

This is a long-term body of work. GitHub is the canonical home. Essays are published deliberately and Revisions or follow-ups become new entries, not silent edits
